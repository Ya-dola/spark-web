The event featured a two-day in-person session conducted by Mr. Yasiru Senarath, an undergraduate at the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa. It focused on the exciting and critical field of ethical hacking, providing both theoretical and practical insights. Day 1 was an introduction to ethical hacking, basic terminal commands, and foundational concepts in cybersecurity. Day 2 was a hands-on workshop covering hardware overviews, setting up Raspberry Pi devices, working with GPIOs, and defending against ARP attacks, including a demonstration of ARP attack and defense techniques. Missed PiMora 2.1? No worries! The full sessions are now available on YouTube: Day1 - https://bit.ly/3rJTDo1 , Day 2 - https://bit.ly/3SzRSWb ",
