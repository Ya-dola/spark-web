          "description": "A group of final-year undergraduates from the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering at the University of Moratuwa developed an innovative virtual cycling platform using Raspberry Pi and virtual reality. The project enables communication between a Raspberry Pi and a BLE-compatible smart trainer, sending data to an AWS cloud server via UDP. The team used the Pycycling Python package and Bleak for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication, leveraging the FTMS protocol to control resistance. Supported by Dialog Axiataâ€™s 5G Innovation Center.",

          "description": "Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are a popular sustainable energy source, but dirt accumulation significantly reduces their efficiency. Existing cleaning methods have drawbacks, including reliance on manual labor and low efficiency. This research introduces a semi-autonomous solar panel cleaning robot capable of both dry and wet cleaning. The robot autonomously navigates solar panels or can be manually controlled via a mobile app. Utilizing the Robot Operating System (ROS), the robot operates for up to 75 minutes on a single charge. It employs image processing algorithms for 96% accuracy in bus bar detection and uses Kalman filters for orientation estimation. The system features two Raspberry Pi 3B+ boards, ultrasonic sensors for safety, a tracked moving mechanism, and a mechanical roller brush with a water pump for effective cleaning.",

          "description": "This project aims to create a virtual cycling platform where two cyclists in different locations can compete using real-world 360-degree videos. It addresses outdoor cycling's safety and comfort concerns while providing a high-intensity interval training experience indoors. The platform utilizes a 5G network for low-latency communication, Oculus VR headsets for immersion, and a Raspberry Pi as a media server for streaming videos. The Raspberry Pi also acts as a game server to synchronize competitions. ESP32 devices measure wheel speed and acceleration to adjust video playback speed. A Firebase-hosted user dashboard displays real-time data such as speed, distance, and heart rate. This project promotes safe cycling, high-intensity training, and potential tourism by showcasing real-world locations.",
